# Browser-Webpack

This is a basic setup for developing browser-based javascript applications.

Development:

`yarn start` - Runs the webpack dev server
`yarn build` - Builds the production bundle

### Files

`public` - This houses the index.html file that is the template for the webpack-html plugin
`src` - Development files such as javascript and css
